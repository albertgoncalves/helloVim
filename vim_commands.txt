:%s/foo/bar/g   find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it
                with 'bar'

:s/foo/bar/g    find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and
                replace it with 'bar'

:%s/foo/bar/gc  change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first

:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc
                change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask
                for confirmation

:%s/foo/bar/gci change each 'foo' (case insensitive due to the i flag) to
                'bar'; ask for confirmation

:%s/foo\c/bar/gc
                is the same because \c makes the search case insensitive
                this may be wanted after using :set noignorecase to make
                searches case sensitive (the default)

:%s/foo/bar/gcI change each 'foo' (case sensitive due to the I flag) to 'bar';
                ask for confirmation

:%s/foo\C/bar/gc
                is the same because \C makes the search case sensitive
                this may be wanted after using :set ignorecase to make searches
                case insensitive
